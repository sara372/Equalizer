# Equalizer
## Introduction
In music world, each instrument have a certain range of frequencies, manipulating this range enables us to amplify, reduce or even delete the sound ofthis instrument in a signal.
In the other way around, we can generate the instrument sound using mathematics, by functions that have a certain frequency and wave form.


## Describtion
My UI enables you to manipulate your song, by controlling some basic instruments, delete them, amplify the or slightly decrease them.
It shows you the signal's wave form and the spectrogram, so you can see the effect of the manipulation you applied.
You can compose a note also by some virtuall instruments provided by the UI.


## How it works
First import your song.
Then you can manipulate the instruments you want.
In another tabs, you will find the virtual instruments where you can compose a little piece of music for you.
